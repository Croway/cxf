that provides several new features and enhancements.  

New features include:

* Many updated dependencies.  We've updated to the latest versions of most
  dependencies.  Some may be incompatible with previous versions.
  Some notables that may impact applications include:
    * ehCache upgraded to 3.9.x
    * Jackson to 2.13.x
    * Mozilla Rhino upgraded to 1.7.13 (groupId/artifactId changed, be careful)

2. Installation Prerequisites 

Before installing Apache CXF, make sure the following products,
with the specified versions, are installed on your system:

    * Java 8 Development Kit
    * Apache Maven 3.x to build the samples


3.  Integrating CXF Into Your Application

If you use Maven to build your application, you need merely add
appropriate dependencies. See the pom.xml files in the samples.

If you don't use Maven, you'll need to add one or more jars to your
classpath. The file lib/WHICH_JARS should help you decide which 
jars you need.

4. Building the Samples

Building the samples included in the binary distribution is easy. Change to
the samples directory and follow the build instructions in the README.txt file 
included with each sample.

5. Reporting Problems

If you have any problems or want to send feedback of any kind, please e-mail the
CXF dev list, dev@cxf.apache.org.  You can also file issues in JIRA at:
